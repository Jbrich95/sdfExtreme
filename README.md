# Spatial deformation for non-stationary extremal dependence
Contains functions for creating spatial deformations to account for nonstationarity
in spatial data. Both correlation based methods and methods adapted for extremal dependence
are included. Accompanies the paper Richards,J., Wadsworth, J. L.<i>Spatial deformation for non-stationary extremal dependence</i>, Environmetrics, to appear.
